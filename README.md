This is a simple Compiler using Bangla syntax and words. Done using Flex and Bison. And Runs on MS2YS.
Due to the terminal being unable to read Bangla words directly, this toy compiler needs an input text file to put the code for the compiler, but the output is shown directly on the MS2YS Terminal.
this only has,

    1) datatype declations(Intger)
    2) User Input for data.
    3) Simple Arithmetic functions.(Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division)
    4) Conditional Statement with multiple conditions.
    
Thank you for checking out this simple toy compiler.
